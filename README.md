# Diseases_Machine_Learning
# Overview
In this project,  we develop a ML machine that can ingest new sample set data and refine the predictions based on user inputted parameters. The output from the data collected would predict the likelihood that the user has a disease or not and reccomend they follow up with their medical provider.

# Project Outline

## Introduction
The instructions for this project were separated into four subsections: Data Model Implementation, Data Model Optimization, GitHub Documentation, Group Presentation. 

## Instructions

1. Create the user interface.
2. Write client-side Python.
3. Connect the app to the notebook.
4. Deploy the app.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python packages via the "requirements.txt" file before running the Webapp.py
   [Requirements File Link](https://github.com/gsingh510/Diseases_Machine_Learning/blob/44f7832aef4e4b69a4c114b67fd2cd8a16fd4271/Project4Group3Final/requirements.txt)

## Features

- Use Python to initialize, train, and evaluate the model
- Clean data in preparation of modeling
- Display up to 75% accuracy for the model
