## Background

In this project,  we develop a ML machine that can ingest new sample set data and refine the predictions based on user inputted parameters. The output from the data collected would predict the decrease the user has so they know which doctor to contact. 

## Features

- Use Python to initialize, train, and evaluate the model
- Clean data in preparation fo modeling
- Utilize tools such as SQL to retrieve data
- Display up to 75% accuracy for the model

## Data Sources

Within resources folder:

[Disease Dataset](Data/Diseases_Machine_Learning-gagan-webAPPInput.csv)


## Built With

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Plotly
- SQL
