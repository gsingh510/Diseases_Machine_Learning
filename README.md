# Diseases Machine Learning
## Overview
In this project,  we develop a ML machine that can ingest new sample set data and refine the predictions based on user inputted parameters. The output from the data collected would predict the likelihood that the user has a disease or not and reccomend they follow up with their medical provider.

# Project Outline

## Introduction
The instructions for this project were separated into four subsections: Data Model Implementation, Data Model Optimization, GitHub Documentation, Group Presentation. 

## Instructions

1. Create the user interface.
2. Write client-side Python.
3. Connect the app to the notebook.
4. Deploy the app.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the [Project4Group3Final](https://github.com/gsingh510/Diseases_Machine_Learning/tree/44f7832aef4e4b69a4c114b67fd2cd8a16fd4271/Project4Group3Final) folder in VS code. 
3. Please install the required Python packages via the "requirements.txt" file before running the Webapp.py
   [Requirements File Link](https://github.com/gsingh510/Diseases_Machine_Learning/blob/44f7832aef4e4b69a4c114b67fd2cd8a16fd4271/Project4Group3Final/requirements.txt)
4. Once the Flask App server is online, take your Dash http enviorment and open in a new tab (preferably Google Chrome).
5. Once opened you will be able to interact with the Dashboard and run the Machine Learning Model. 

## Features

- Use Python to initialize, train, and evaluate the model
- Clean data in preparation of modeling
- Display up to 75% accuracy for the model
